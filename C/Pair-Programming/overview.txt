p1 worked mins = n
p2 worked mins = m

lines already written len = k

Actions -
	1. Add a new line to the end
	2. Change one of its lines

p1 sequence of actions = (arr) a
p2 sequence of actions = (arr) b

if a[i] = 0 then he applies Actions.1
if a[i] > 0 then he applies Actions.2 then he changes the line with the number a[i]
